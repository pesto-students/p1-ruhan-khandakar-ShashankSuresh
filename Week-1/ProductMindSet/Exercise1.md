### Smarto SmartRoom

Make your online class easy with SmartRoom. Online sessions with chat, MCQ to Conferences, do all of these with a single click.

As we know future will be led from our room. And this is not the exception for Colleges, Tuitions, conferences, Official Meeting etc. Our aim is to solve all of these problems in the easiest and most efficient way. So we came up with our great product which is **SmartRoom.** Now give lectures with a whiteboard and chatting support, take attendances, and do one-on-one meetings to conferences with just a single click. And another best thing is, we don’t have any hidden charges. It’s just simple like your read this paragraph :).

We know there are a lot of similar products but none of them gives all facilities which we are giving with the most efficient way and transparent pricing. From a single web / mobile app you’ll all of the things which you need.

Our main motive is to give you a solution with a single click, to target more audiences we support from the web and mobile apps, including iOS and Android. And we ensure you can join or take any sessions with 3G Network. But obviously, for the Higher Speed network, you’ll get some more facilities like more than 100 participants at once. Apart from all of these we make sure that For colleges/school lectures, teachers can use the **White Board** in a more elegant way, that’s why we support the **pen** system along with **mouse** support.

This is what we were looking for, It is so easy to use and gives all controls which we need. I strongly recommended using this for all of the online session things —- St. Martin College’s Principal
